## How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts and focusing on modularity and clarity. I start by identifying the core components, their interactions, and the functionality required for each. This project highlighted the importance of early planning, as it allowed me to align the design with the objectives and constraints, ensuring a seamless integration of features.

## What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

Through this project, I honed my ability to design interactive and dynamic systems. Implementing modular classes for circles, bricks, and the paddle enhanced my understanding of encapsulation and object-oriented principles. I also developed skills in designing visual feedback mechanisms, such as altering brick colors to reflect damage, to make the user experience more engaging.

## What design process did you follow for your project work?

I followed an iterative design process that involved planning, implementation, and testing. Initially, I outlined the features needed, such as physics-based collisions and interactive controls. I then implemented these features step-by-step, testing each component individually to ensure it worked as intended. Iterations allowed me to refine the design and address any issues that arose.

## How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

The modular approach and iterative process I used can be applied to any project requiring scalability and clarity. By focusing on breaking tasks into smaller pieces and iterating on feedback, I can ensure future projects are efficient and maintainable.

## How do I approach developing programs?

I approach program development by starting small and building incrementally, testing each feature as I go. I focus on writing clean, modular code that adheres to best practices, such as clear naming conventions and thorough commenting. This ensures the code is not only functional but also easy to understand and extend.

## What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

I adopted a strategy of modular development by creating separate classes for bricks, circles, and the paddle. This allowed me to focus on each component's specific behavior and made debugging simpler. I also integrated visual feedback and dynamic physics for a more immersive experience.

## How did iteration factor into your development?

Iteration was essential for refining the features and fixing issues. For example, I iteratively improved collision detection and fine-tuned the movement logic of the circles to ensure smooth and realistic interactions. Each iteration brought me closer to achieving the project goals.

## How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project's completion?

My approach has become more structured and methodical. I've learned to prioritize modularity, test frequently, and rely on clear design principles to guide development. These milestones reinforced the value of planning and iterating over the code for better results.

## How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer science equips me with the tools to solve complex problems and build solutions that are both creative and practical. It enables me to turn abstract ideas into tangible products, which is essential for achieving my professional and educational aspirations.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

Computational graphics teach me how to translate theoretical concepts, like geometry and physics, into visual representations. This project improved my understanding of rendering, collision detection, and user interaction, all of which can be applied to future coursework involving visual simulations or game development.

## How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

In a professional context, computational graphics and visualizations provide the foundation for creating interactive applications, simulations, and visual analytics tools. These skills are invaluable in fields like software development, data visualization, and even virtual reality, broadening my career opportunities. This project has enhanced my ability to design engaging visual systems, a skill I can leverage in future projects.
